# Studies on 'A Curious Moon' by Big Machine

## Purpose
As part of my day-to-day role, I'm often involved in incidents. During those incidents, the requirement for more advanced skills in SQL grows dramatically and is paired with extreme time pressure. Exploring this learning text is an effort to upskill in this area.

## Approach
Whilst the text encourages one to use a local postgres, I choose to use a docker container. As such, I expect to improve the automation of running the container and populating it with the data.
